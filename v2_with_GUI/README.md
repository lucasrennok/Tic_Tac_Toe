When you run the program you will have to choose offline mode or online mode

### Offline
You will have to choose if you are going to play alone or with a friend

After that you will choose if you will be the first, so if you will select the first coordinate at the game

And the game starts

### Online
You will have to choose if you will create the game or connect to a game that was created

If you chose to create a game, press start and wait your friend, when he connects to your game the window will change

If you chose to connect to a game, type your friend's ip at the input text and then press the button to connect to the game, after a few seconds the window will change

After that, you and the other player will be at the game, the Player 1 is the person that connected to the game and the Player 2 is the person that created the game, so good luck and good game.

Obs.: Avoid clicking on the window when it's not your turn, in that moments the game is waiting for data from your friend and if you click somewhere the window can change to "not responding"

#### Rules
The players can't select the same coordinate, only coordinates which don't have numbers

The players can only select the coordinates at the GUI
